# Crypo-Project 

In the following project I have made a simple crypto price tracker app using kotlin. I have implemented the basic functionalities of recycle view, API integration and search view.

I have used API from coinmarketcap.com.

The Following step were used in creating the follwing project 

1. Creating a the layout - Activity Main and recycle view.

   a. Activity main contains the layout of the home the screen of the app which consist of recycleview and search view.

   b. Recycle view layout define the structure of recyle view.


2. Creating a three koltin files - Mianactivity, Adaptor file and model class.

   a. Main Activity contains the intreaction code of the app.

   b. Adaptor file defines how the data is added to recycle view.

   c. Model class is created to define the type of data present in the recycle view.

3. Generating API key from coinbasemarket and checking the working on postman application.

4. Integrating the API into the main activity file and extracting the neccessary data from it.

5. Adding of the data into the recycleview file.

6. Finally Implementing the search view into the main activity file.

Using the following step the crypto price tracker app is created. Enjoy!
